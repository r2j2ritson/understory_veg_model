#Name: VegRoadIntersect.py
# Purpose: Determine the type of vegetation within 100 meters of all stream crossings

# Import system modules
import arcpy
 
# Set the workspace (to avoid having to type in the full path to the data every time)
arcpy.env.workspace = "//hqwildstat/$D/Fine scale vegetation analysis/Erin Rcode/veg_model/spatial/prediction_maps/prediction_maps.gdb"    

# Process: Find all stream crossings (points)
inFeature1 = "HighwaysandRoadsITD_CopyFeat"
inFeature2 = "Unit_43_48"
intersectOutput = inFeature2+"_roads"
clusterTolerance = 1.5

# Process: Buffer all stream crossings by 100 meters
bufferOutput = intersectOutput+"_1000m"

# Process: Clip the vegetation feature class to stream_crossing_100m

#clipOutput = "veg_within_100m_of_crossings"

# Process: Summarize how much (area) of each type of vegetation is found
# within 100 meter of the stream crossings
